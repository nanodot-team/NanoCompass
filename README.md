# NanoCompass
Plugin for Spigot server which shows compass on player's actionbar made by NanoDot. Team.

# Quick tutorial
You can change if plugin is enabled or disabled in NanoCompass' config.yml file.
You can change if compass is displayed for you using /mcompass wylacz (OFF) or /mcompass wlacz (ON) commands, these options are saved in config.yml, so after restart they do not change :)
